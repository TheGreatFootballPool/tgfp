The Great Football Pool

As stated in my blog post I thought it would be fun to make the project a ‘white box’ or ‘turnkey’ 
solution for other people who want to run their own friends and family "pick 'em" style football pool.

I've written a bit more about this project on my blog:
[Making The Great Football Pool a Turnkey Product](https://johnsturgeon.me/2024/01/11/project-to-productize-tgfp)

## Current state of the project

Here's the [project backlog](https://github.com/orgs/TheGreatFootballPool/projects/2) on github

This repo will serve as the main repo with everything needed for me to host the site.

## Current state
* Simple FastAPI Docker container created

## Next step
* publish docker to docker hub on git push
